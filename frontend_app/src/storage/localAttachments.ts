/**
 * Node attachments in local mode, kept as files beside the map.
 *
 * Up to 0.6.2 the original of every attachment rode inside the map as
 * `inline_data_base64`, so a map with a hundred photos carried all of them
 * through every save and every undo step. Now each original is a file of its
 * own under the vault folder, encrypted with a key of its own. That key sits
 * in the attachment ref, inside the encrypted map: the file is exactly as
 * protected as the inline copy was, and a password change — which gives the
 * profile a new master key but leaves the maps alone — does not orphan it.
 *
 * Maps saved by older versions still carry inline originals. They are moved
 * out when the map is opened (`externalizeInlineAttachments`), and an export
 * puts them back in (`inlineLocalAttachments`), so a `.mmvault` file stays
 * self-contained and readable by any version.
